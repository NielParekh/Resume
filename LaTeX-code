\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
{\bf Internship at Siqsess Technologies } 
\hfill{\textbf{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Oct-Nov'19}}} \\
Worked on software development for Arduino boards integrated with various sensors and basic display elements (2x16 LCD, 8 segment display and a 16x16 LCD). Was also exposed to other boards like nodeMCU (Wi-Fi) and HM-10 (Bluetooth). Was also exposed to web page design and controlling Arduino boards using a HTML page and then went on to learn to control the Arduino using an app made using visual studios. Lastly,  connected the Arduino to the thingspeak cloud using the nodeMCU and pushed data into the cloud and extracted data from it.\\
{\bf Internship at Prosimo} 
\hfill{\textbf{\textcolor{OliveGreen}{Jun'20 - Aug'20}}} \\
The primary goal of this internship is to build these data visualizations and dashboards in Kibana using data injected into Elasticsearch. There were two stages of work involved - data injection and data visualization. In the data injection stage, I worked on a script in python to read the data from cloud storage like AWS S3 using Boto3, manipulate the data to be compatible to store as Elasticsearch documents and insert it into elastic search database. In the data visualization phase, I built Kibana visualizations, dashboards. The 3 main dashboards were - Testbed Infrastructure visibitity, Test suite and Testcase Visibilty and User access statistics of web applications.
