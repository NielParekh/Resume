\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
{\bf Internship at Siqsess Technologies } \hfill{\textbf{{Oct-Nov'2019}}} \\
Worked on software development for Arduino boards, sensors (ultrasonic, vibration, light intensity, sound, vibrational etc) and basic display elements (2x16 LCD, 8 segment display and a 16x16 LCD). Was also exposed to other boards like nodeMCU (Wi-Fi) and HM-10 (Bluetooth). Worked with high precision stepper motors and controlling them with Arduino code. Was also exposed to web page design and controlling Arduino boards using a HTML page and then went on to learn to control the Arduino using an app made using visual studios. Lastly,  connected the Arduino to the thingspeak cloud using the nodeMCU and pushed data into the cloud and extracted data from it. \\
